# Final project for MOB 1.3

### Important Dates
Date Assigned: February 7<br>
Github repository due date: March 7 (Github repository)<br>
Testflight due date: March 8

### Description and Requirements

For this term you will complete an individual project that solves a problem using an iOS app. The domain is up to you and the main purpose of this assignment is to have a new entry in your personal portfolio. That means the app **MUST** be available in the App Store by the end of March this year.

All students will give a small presentation on March 7 on their project (5 min max per student). And will have an individual grading session (final code review) to be scheduled later in the term.

Your solution should incorporate the following tools learned throughout the term:
- Closures
- Making requests
- Handling JSON
- Communication patterns

**Basic requirements:**

- The app should make network requests to an existing API (public or built by you).
- The app should handle communication including at least 2 different communication patterns (Delegation, Notifications, etc.).
- The app should be fully functional and must include at least 3 different screens.
- The app should demonstrate care on UI/UX. (Get user feedback early!) This includes correct messaging and ease of use.
- The code should be well documented and show efforts of adhering to good conventions.
- When asked about decisions made in the code, you should be able to justify your choices. (Why choosing a pattern over the over, memory management decisions, on the architecture used).
