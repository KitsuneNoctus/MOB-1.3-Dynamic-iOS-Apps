## Course Description

This course covers the programming concepts needed to create dynamic iOS applications that can respond to user events. Key concepts include closures, callbacks and delegations. Students will understand how these constructs work and how they are used to pass information between views and objects. Common communication patterns and roles will also be explored. Students will also learn how to fetch and parse information from the Internet through APIs. They will interact with public APIs with and without authentication, make network requests in iOS using native Swift tools, model a networking layer in iOS, and parse a JSON network response using native Swift tools.

### Why you should know this

Most if not all mobile apps will need to communicate with an external service to work. It's important for you to know how to create this communication flow using the native Swift tools, this will allow you to understand networking libraries available. In the other hand, communication within an app is also something you will need to implement as your apps get more complex. When you know different approaches to this problem, you'll be able to choose the one that best suits a specific need.

## Prerequisites:  

- [MOB 1.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/MOB-1.2-Introduction-to-iOS-Development-in-Swift)
- [BEW 1.1](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/BEW-1.1-RESTful-and-Resourceful-MVC-Architecture)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to ...

1. Explain and use closures and callbacks to pass and delegate information between views/objects
1. Identify and use different communication patterns in iOS
1. Explain how memory management works in Swift
1. Use public APIs with or without authentication
1. Parse a JSON network response and demonstrate how to make a network request using a networking layer
