# Dynamic iOS Apps

## Course Description

This course covers the programming concepts needed to create dynamic iOS applications that can respond to user events. Key concepts include closures, callbacks and delegations. Students will understand how these constructs work and how they are used to pass information between views and objects. Common communication patterns and roles will also be explored. Students will also learn how to fetch and parse information from the internet through APIs. They will interact with public API's with and without authentication, make network requests in iOS using native Swift tools, model a networking layer in iOS, and parse a JSON network response using native Swift tools.
