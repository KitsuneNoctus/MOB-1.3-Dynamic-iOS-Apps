## Course Description

This course covers the programming concepts needed to create dynamic iOS applications that can respond to user events. Key concepts include closures, callbacks and delegations. Students will understand how these constructs work and how they are used to pass information between views and objects. Common communication patterns and roles will also be explored. Students will also learn how to fetch and parse information from the Internet through APIs. They will interact with public APIs with and without authentication, make network requests in iOS using native Swift tools, model a networking layer in iOS, and parse a JSON network response using native Swift tools.

### Why you should know this

Most if not all mobile apps will need to communicate with an external service to work. It's important for you to know how to create this communication flow using the native Swift tools, this will allow you to understand networking libraries available. In the other hand, communication within an app is also something you will need to implement as your apps get more complex. When you know different approaches to this problem, you'll be able to choose the one that best suits a specific need.

## Tutorials & Class Assignments

Tutorials are to help you get started in a topic.  Tutorials and class assignments are graded on completion only.

- [Tutorial for Closures & ARC](https://github.com/MakeSchool-Tutorials/Functions-Closures-and-ARC)
- [Product Hunt Tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/product-hunt-api-tutorial)
- [Communication patterns Exercise](https://github.com/amelinagzz/pom-starter)
- Alamofire + Firebase Exercise
- Sockets project

## Final project

Individual project covering core concepts from this course.
- [Final project](Projects/FinalProject.md)

### Projects and Tutorials
**All projects and tutorials will require a minimum of 10 commits, and must take place throughout the entirety of the course**

- **Good Example:** 40+ commits throughout the length of the course, looking for a healthy spattering of commits each week (such as 3-5 per day).
- **Bad Example:** 10 commits on one day during the course and no others. Students who do this will be at severe risk of not passing the class.
- **Unacceptable Example:** 2 commits the day before a project is due. Students who do this should not expect to pass the class.

#### Why are we doing this?

We want to encourage best practices that you will see working as a professional software engineer. Breaking up a project by doing a large amount of commits helps engineers in the following ways:

- It's much easier to retrace your steps if you break your project/product/code up into smaller pieces
- It helps with being able to comprehend the larger problem, and also will help with your debugging (i.e. finding exactly when you pushed that piece of broken code)
- It allows for more streamlined, iterative communication in your team, as it's much easier to hand off a small change to someone (updating a function) than a huge one (changed the architecture of the project)

Through this requirement, we hope to encourage you to think about projects with an iterative, modular mindset. Doing so will allow you to break projects down into smaller milestones that come together to make your fully-realized solution.

Projects are a chance for you to build and ship code that is based on class concepts.  Many are open ended allowing you to be creative and to have individual work for your portfolio.

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Complete all required tutorials & assignments
- Pass all projects according to the associated project rubric
- Pass the final summative assessment >=75%
- Actively participate in class and abide by the attendance policy
- Make up all classwork from all absences

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
