## Overview






### Domain Model

**A Definition**</br>
In software engineering, a **domain model** is a conceptual model of the domain that ___incorporates both behavior and data.___ <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

**Implementation is in Layers**</br>
A domain model is commonly implemented as an **[object model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_model)** - *a collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate specific parts of its world.*<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

It is typically comprised of:<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
1. A lower-level **persistence layer**
2. A higher-level **API layer** to gain access to the data and behavior of the model.

In this class, we will expand our proficiency with MVC by implementing an ___API Layer___ designed to manage access to the data and functionality of the *Model* layer.
