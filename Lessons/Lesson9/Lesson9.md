## Overview






### Domain Model

**A Definition**
In software engineering, a **domain model** is a conceptual model of the domain that ___incorporates both behavior and data.___ <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

**Implementation in Layers**
It is typically implemented as an **[object model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_model)** within a layer that uses:<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
1. A lower-level layer for persistence and "publishes"
2. An API to a higher-level layer to gain access to the data and behavior of the model.

For this class, we will focus specifically on item 2. above - ___The API Layer___ that manages access to the data and functionality of the *Model* in MVC.
