## Why you should know this

xxx

<!-- puts request logic into a separate object, and we call this object a store (Figure 28.4). Using a store object minimizes redundant code and simplifies the code that fetches and saves data. Most importantly, it moves the logic for dealing with an external source into a tidy class with a clear and focused goal. This makes code easier to understand, which makes it easier to maintain and debug, as well as share with other programmers on your team.

## Overview






### Domain Model

**A Definition**</br>
In software engineering, a **domain model** is a conceptual model of the domain that ___incorporates both behavior and data.___ <sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

**Implementation is in Layers**</br>
A domain model is commonly implemented as an **[object model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_model)** - *a collection of objects or classes through which a program can examine and manipulate specific parts of its world.*<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

It is typically comprised of:<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>
1. A lower-level **persistence layer**
2. A higher-level **API layer** to gain access to the data and behavior of the model.

In this class, we will expand our proficiency with MVC by implementing an ___API Layer___ designed to manage access to the data and functionality of the *Model* layer.
</br>

### Key Application Design Principles

As a design pattern, MVC seeks to promote two important design principles fundamental to OOP:

1. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** - Represents a ___modular___ approach to constructing an application in which code can be separated into logical sections, each addressing separate areas of functional behavior (concerns). SoC results in higher degrees of freedom for because it hides the need for a given section to know particular information addressed by other sections.

 - MVC can separate content from presentation and data-processing (model) from content.
 - Service-oriented design can separate concerns into services.

 2. **Reusability** - If correctly implemented, view and model layers can easily be composed of reusable, modular components (though controllers are seldom reusable).


### MVC's Current State

As the complexity of iOS app development evolves, design patterns have emerged to address shortcomings of the standard MVC model. The hype of many promising new iOS architectures can be misleading.

As a developer, you need to be aware of the pros and cons of emerging iOS design patterns such as:

1. **Model-View-ViewModel pattern (MVVM)** - Like MVC, but it adds a fourth component - the ___view model.___ The view model is responsible for managing the model and passing data to view controllers in a format ready to be displayed on the screen, relieving controllers of these responsibilities.

2. **View-Interactor-Presenter-Entity-Routing (VIPER)** - Expands MVC to include intermediary components which handle specific tasks and reduces interaction with the model, view and controller to a single point of contact. For example, views and view controllers now only detect user interaction and display data; the Presenter responds to user interaction information received from the controller, fetches and prepares data for presentation.

3. **Model-View-Controller-Store (MVCS)** - An expansion on MVC in which data request logic is moved out of the controller and into separate modules/objects specifically designed to fetch the data, regardless of where the data comes from (from a server, local file, a database, etc).
- This could also be thought of as ___"Model-View-Controller-Service,"___ where a *service layer* handles fetching and processing data.


But behind them all is simply the principle of **Separation of Concerns** being applied in specific ways to MVC...


### Project Organization

Structure and organization are key contributors to effective modularized architecture.

Creating groups folder is a great place to start.

*Note that controllers, views, and model are only suggestions - feel free to name yours whatever makes sense in your project.*

### Service Objects

The core component of our API Layer is the **Service** or **API object.**

It's the job of this object to:

- Fetch, post and process data to and from the target web services
- Serialize JSON data for manipulation and presentation
- Provide constructs for handling the successful or failed state of web service requests and responses


### The Model Object

Sometime scalled a *Transfer Object* (aka, a TO), a *Value Object,* or a *Data Transfer Object (DTO),* model objects are an important component of an efficient network service layer.

They represent a single, simple data instance that can be used in multiple ways. They can be used in data fetch and retrieval operations, data storage/persistence, presentation to the user (i.e., to populate a table cellâ€™s data, for example), and more.

Here is a classic example of a user represented (modeled) as a Codable struct with 3 properties:

```Swift
struct User:Codable {
    var first_name:String
    var last_name:String
    var country:String
}
```



### The Request Builder

The Builder design pattern solves problems like:[2]

How can a class (the same construction process) create different representations of a complex object?
How can a class that includes creating a complex object be simplified?
