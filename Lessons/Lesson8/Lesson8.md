## Why you should know this

As the use of the **HTTP protocol** evolved, so have the efforts of Internet bad guys to exploit its **many inherent weaknesses** for their own nefarious ends.

In fact, HTTP is such an insecure protocol that Apple has all but prohibited its use in iOS apps.

Over the last few releases of iOS, Apple has redesigned iOS's networking frameworks to work natively with **HTTP's secure counterpart: HTTPS.**

And the primary difference between HTTPS and HTTP?

- *HTTPS requires Authentication.*

Thus, every iOS developer *must* know how to implement HTTPS-based network calls with Authentication.


<!-- TODO: find exact date and iOS version in which Apple made this changes -->

In Groups of 3 - (8 min)
- Share your thoughts about your selection.

As A Class - (6 min)
- We'll choose 3 review topics. Volunteers to explain each.




## Network Authentication for iOS

## Secure HTTP (HTTPS)



## Two Types

Authentication for HTTPS comes in two distinct implementation types:

- OAUTH
- API Keys


<!-- TOODO: research and briefly explain each type -->
