## Initial Exercise (5 min)

## In Class Activity I (15 min)

For both parts of this exercise, we will use these 3 resources:
1.  [https://httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/#/Request_inspection/get_headers)
- Specifically, we will be sending a GET request that will return the incoming request's HTTP headers from their web service's Request Inspection endpoint.
2. Nasa's public [Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html)
3. The [DailyPlanet starter app](https://github.com/VanderDev1/DailyPlanet)
