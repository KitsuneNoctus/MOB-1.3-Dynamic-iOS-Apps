## Why you should know this

Nearly every professional-level iOS app communicates at some point with an Internet component such as a remote web service.

And the most commonly-used protocol for communicating with web servers is HTTP (and its secure counterpart, HTTPS) to make GET and POST network requests.

HTTP and HTTPS are robust and stable protocols. They have been widely used in web browsers for a long time. They offer several performance and security advantages, as well as a mature base of easy-to-use development and analysis tools.

Fetching and processing data between an app and a web service is an essential skill that all iOS developers must master.

Since iOS 7, Apple has provided URLSession and its related classes as a complete networking API for uploading or downloading content via HTTP/S.
